MotoLogr NZ was a private vehicle budgeting app intended to be used to track expenses specific to the New Zealand market.

At the time of its cancellation, it was almost feature-complete with the ability to keep track of compliances, export expenses in a well-structured pdf, and the ability to track fuel consumption.

Its final release would have seen a graph for displaying data such as fuel consumption as well as the ability to export a mechanical report when on-selling the vehicle.

It was cancelled due to very limited market interest.
